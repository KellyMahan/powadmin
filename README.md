PowAdmin
========

A simple way of issue restarts, stops and starts for pow configs.

### UPDATE

Pow is now adding in a web based admin that will be more integrated than what this application can accomplish.
[https://github.com/37signals/pow/tree/pow.dev](pow/pow.dev)

Future development will probably cease once the pow.dev branch is complete.


Install
-------

first install pow

> `curl get.pow.cx | sh`

then install powadmin

> `git clone git://github.com/KellyMahan/powadmin.git`
>
> ``ln -s `pwd`/powadmin ~/.pow/powadmin``

restart pow

and open your browser to [http://powadmin.dev](http://powadmin.dev)

Work In Progress
----------------

The plan is to add on to some more functionality, such as installing a new project to pow and removing a project from pow. Also to improve on the design so it isn't just a block of text. 

But first i just wanted to get this out there to get some feedback.
